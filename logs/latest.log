[11:39:47] [main/INFO]: Loading Minecraft 1.20.1 with Fabric Loader 0.16.10
[11:39:47] [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-13/WARN]: Mod mr_dungeons_andtaverns uses the version 3.0.3.f which isn't compatible with Loader's extended semantic version format (Could not parse version number component 'f'!), SemVer is recommended for reliably evaluating dependencies and prioritizing newer version
[11:39:47] [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-14/WARN]: Mod gravestones uses the version v1.15 which isn't compatible with Loader's extended semantic version format (Could not parse version number component 'v1'!), SemVer is recommended for reliably evaluating dependencies and prioritizing newer version
